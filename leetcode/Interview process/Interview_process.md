## Interview Process

Problem:
```
Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+'.

For example, in "alice@leetcode.com", "alice" is the local name, and "leetcode.com" is the domain name.
If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.
If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered. Note that this rule does not apply to domain names.

For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com".
It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given an array of strings emails where we send one email to each emails[i], return the number of different addresses that actually receive mails.
```

```scala
Input: emails = ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails.
```

          localName ++ "@" ++ emailParts.last
        }.toSet.size

Problem:
```
You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.
```

```scala
Input: emails = ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails.
